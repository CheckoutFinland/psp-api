# Checkout PSP API

This is the API reference and example documentation for [Checkout Finland](https://checkout.fi/) - a Payment Service Provider with
which ecommerce merchants can accept payments mobile and online.

OpenAPI 3 specification for the API is also [available for download](checkout-psp-api.yaml).

<p class="tip">
If you have any feedback regarding how we could improve the documentation, [please file an issue on Github](https://github.com/CheckoutFinland/psp-api/issues).
You can also ask for support by opening an issue on GitHub.
Thank you!
</p>

If you are looking for the [legacy API documentation, see this](https://checkoutfinland.github.io/legacy-api/).

## API endpoint

* API endpoint is `api.checkout.fi`

## Test credentials

Please note that not all payment methods support testing, so only the payment methods that support testing payments are enabled for these credentials. Provider specific credentials for approving payments can be found from [providers tab](/payment-method-providers#test-credentials).

### Normal merchant account

* Merchant ID: `375917`
* Secret key: `SAIPPUAKAUPPIAS`

### Shop-in-Shop merchant account

*Note:* Use these only if you are setting up a [Shop-in-Shop](https://checkout.fi/verkkokauppiaalle/palvelu/shop-in-shop/) web shop.

* Aggregate merchant ID: `695861`
* Aggregate secret key: `MONISAIPPUAKAUPPIAS`
* Shop-in-Shop merchant ID: `695874`

## HTTP response summary

General API HTTP status codes and what to expect of them.

Code | Text | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
200  | OK   | Everything worked as expected.
201  | Created | A payment/refund was created successfully.
400  | Bad Request |The request was unacceptable, probably due to missing a required parameter.
401  | Unauthorized | HMAC calculation failed or Merchant has no access to this feature.
404  | Not Found | The requested resource doesn't exist.
422  | Unprocessable Entity | The requested method is not supported.

## Headers and request signing

All API calls need to be signed using HMAC and SHA-256 or SHA-512. When a request contains a body, the body must be valid JSON and a `content-type` header with the value `application/json; charset=utf-8` must be included.

All API responses are signed the same way, allowing merchant to verify response validity. In addition, the reponses contain `cof-request-id` header. Saving or logging the value of this header is recommended.

The signature is transmitted in the `signature` HTTP header. Signature payload consists of the following fields separated with a line feed (\n). Carrige returns (\r) are not supported.

* All `checkout-` headers in alphabetical order. The header keys must be in lowercase. Each header key and value are separated with `:`
* HTTP body, or empty string if no body

The headers are:

field | info | description
--- | --- | ---
`checkout-account` | numeric | Checkout account ID, eg. 375917
`checkout-algorithm` | string | Used signature algorithm, either `sha256` or `sha512`
`checkout-method` | string | HTTP verb of the request, either `GET` or `POST`
`checkout-nonce` | string | Unique identifier for this request
`checkout-timestamp` | string | ISO 8601 date time
`checkout-transaction-id` | string | Checkout transaction ID when accessing single transaction - not required for a new payment request

The HTTP verb, nonce and timestamp are used to mitigate various replay and timing attacks. Below is an example payload passed to a HMAC function:

```
checkout-account:1234\n
checkout-algorithm:sha256\n
checkout-method:POST\n
checkout-nonce:1234\n
checkout-timestamp:2018-07-05T11:19:25.950Z\n
REQUEST BODY
```

In addition to headers included in HMAC calculation `cof-plugin-version` header can be provided. Checkout kindly requests that ecommerce platform plugin or marketplace integrations would set the header for both statistical and customer service reasons.

See also code examples of [HMAC calculation in node.js](/examples#hmac-calculation-node-js) and [HMAC calculation in PHP](/examples#hmac-calculation-php).

### Redirect and callback URL signing

Return and callback URL parameters are also signed, and the merchant *must* check the signature validity. The signature is calculated the same way as for requests, but the values come in as query string parameters instead of headers. Empty string is used for the body.

## Payments

Actions related to the payment object are mapped to `/payments` API endpoint.

The following illustrates how the user moves in the payment process.

<div class='mermaid'>
sequenceDiagram

Client ->> Merchant: Proceed to checkout
Merchant ->> api.checkout.fi: Initiate new payment (POST /payments)
api.checkout.fi ->> Merchant: JSON with payment methods
Merchant ->> Client: Render payment method buttons
Client ->> Payment method provider: Submits chosen payment form
Payment method provider -->> Client: Redirect to Checkout success/cancel URL
Client -->> api.checkout.fi: success/cancel

opt Callback URL
  api.checkout.fi ->> Merchant: Call success/cancel callback URL
end

api.checkout.fi -->> Client: Redirect to Merchant success/cancel URL
Client ->> Merchant: Return to success/cancel
Merchant ->> Client: Render thank you -page
</div>

### Create

`HTTP POST /payments` creates a new open payment and returns a JSON object that includes the available payment methods. The merchant web shop renders HTML forms from the response objects (see [example](/examples#payment-provider-form-rendering)). The client browser will submit the form to the payment method provider.

Once the payment has been completed the client browser will return to the merchant provided redirect URL.

The request payload is described below, as well as the redirect and callback URL parameters. [JSON example payload and response](/examples#create) are available on the examples tab.

See [an example payload and response](/examples#create)

#### Redirect and callback URL parameters

Once the payment is complete, or cancelled, the client browser is normally redirected to the merchant provided URL. If merchant has provided a callback URL, it will be called too. The callback is called with `HTTP GET` and with the same query string parameters as in the redirect. The callback URL should respond with `HTTP 20x`.

<p class="warning">
  The URLs may be called multiple times. The merchant web shop must be able to handle multiple requests for the same purchase.
</p>

The payment information is available in the query string parameters of the client request. For example, if the `redirectUrls.success` value was `https://example.org`, it would be accessed with parameters appended:

> https://example.org/51/success/return?checkout-account=375917&checkout-algorithm=sha256&checkout-amount=2964&checkout-stamp=15336332710015&checkout-reference=192387192837195&checkout-transaction-id=4b300af6-9a22-11e8-9184-abb6de7fd2d0&checkout-status=ok&checkout-provider=nordea&signature=b2d3ecdda2c04563a4638fcade3d4e77dfdc58829b429ad2c2cb422d0fc64080


The query string parameters are listed below. If callback URLs were provided, same parameters are used.

field | info |  description
----- | ---- |  -----------
`checkout-account` | numeric | Checkout account ID
`checkout-algorithm` | string | Used signature algorithm. The same as used by merchant when creating the payment.
`checkout-amount` | numeric | Payment amount in currency minor unit, eg. cents
`checkout-stamp` | string | Merchant provided stamp
`checkout-reference` | string | Merchant provided reference
`checkout-transaction-id` | string | Checkout provided transaction ID.<br><br>**Important:** Store the value. It is needed for other actions such as refund or payment information query
`checkout-status` | string | Payment status, either `ok`, `pending`, or `fail`. Pending transactions should eventually be reported as successful or failed via the callbacks, if provided, and using the redirect URLs.
`checkout-provider` | string | The payment method provider the client used. Current values are documented on [providers tab](/payment-method-providers#test-credentials). The values are subject to change without notice.
`signature` | string | HMAC signature calculated from other parameter

Merchant must check that signature is valid. Signature is calculated as described [above](#redirect-and-callback-url-signing). **Do not** implement the HMAC validation with hardcoded query string parameters since new ones may be added later. Instead, filter parameters by name (include all that begin with `checkout-`), then sort, and calculate the HMAC.

### Get

<p class="warning">
  The GET endpoint has not been implemented yet. The endpoint does respond but with payload that does not match any documentation.
  <br><br>
  It is currently intended only for the integrating partners to see at least some change in payment state when it has been paid.
</p>


`HTTP GET /payments/{transactionId}` returns payment information.

### Refund

`HTTP POST /payments/{transactionId}/refund` refunds a payment by transaction ID.

<p class="tip">
  Asynchronous refunds are planned for later implementation. It is advised that integrating partners implement refunds with this in mind, as it will be the primary method for refunds later.
  Technically this means that when a refund request is accepted, an OK response is sent to the caller. Later, when the refund is processed, the callback will be called with the actual outcome.
</p>

#### HTTP request body

field | info | description
----- | ---- | -----------
amount | integer | Total amount to refund, in currency's minor units
email | string | Email address. Accepted only if using [email refund API](#email-refund)
items | [RefundItem](#refunditem)[] | Array of items to refund. Use only for Shop-in-Shop payments.
callbackUrls | [CallbackUrl](#callbackurl) | Which urls to ping after the refund has been processed. The callback is called with `HTTP GET` and with the same query string parameters as in the [payment request callback](#redirect-and-callback-url-parameters). The server should respond with `HTTP 20x`.

##### RefundItem

field | info | description
----- | ---- | -----------
amount | integer | Total amount to refund this item, in currency's minor units
stamp | string | Unique stamp of the refund item
commission | [RefundCommission](#RefundCommission) | Shop-in-Shop commission return. In refunds, the given amount is returned from the given commission account to the item merchant account.

##### RefundCommission

field | type | required | example | description
----- | ---- | -------- | ------- | -----------
merchant | string | <center>x</center> | 695874 | Merchant from whom the commission is returned to the submerchant.
amount | integer | <center>x</center> | 250 | Amount of commission in currency's minor units, eg. for Euros use cents. VAT not applicable.

See [an example payload and response](/examples#refund)

#### Response

Status code | Explanation
------------|------------
201 | Refund created successfully
400 | Something went wrong
422 | Used payment method provider does not support refunds

Note, that at the moment HTTP 400 may occur also for 3rd party reasons - eg. bacause Nordea test API does not support refunds.

### Email refund

`HTTP POST /payments/{transactionId}/refund/email` refunds a payment by transaction ID by email and IBAN.

Since not all payment method providers support refunds (namely, S-pankki, √Ölandsbanken, and AinaPay) an email refund API is provided. Email refund API sends a link to the intended recipient where they input their IBAN, authenticate using Tupas, and then receive the refund in 1-3 days. Email refund is supported for all Finnish banks, and AinaPay.

#### Response

Status code | Explanation
------------|------------
201 | Refund created successfully
400 | Something went wrong
422 | Used payment method provider does not support email refunds

## Payment Reports

Checkout provides an API for asynchronous payment report generation. A merchant can view their payments in this report. A call to the endpoint must contain a callback URL where the payment report will be delivered to once it has been generated.

The endpoint supports specifying whether the result will be delivered as a JSON payload or as a CSV file. It also supports field filtering and some result filtering.
